# Common Programming Concepts

## Variables
- by default, variables are immutable
- use `let mut` to enable mutability
- `const` aren't just immutable by default - they're always immutable
  - type must be declared: `const MAX_POINTS: u32 = 100_000;`

## Scalar Types
- integers, floating-point numbers, Booleans, and characters
- unsigned types = only positive, ie. `u32`
- integer types default: `i32` - type is fastest, even on 64-bit systems
- floating-point types: `f32` and `f64` (default)

## Boolean
- example: `let f: bool =  false;`

## Char
- `char` literals are specified with single quotes, as opposed to string literals, which use double quotes

## Compound Types (tuples, arrays)
### Tuples
- general way of grouping together a number of values with a variety of types into one compound type
- tuples have a fixed length: once declared, they cannot grow or shrink in size
### Arrays
- every element of an array must have the same type
- arrays have fixed lengths
- arrays are useful when you want your data allocated on the stack rather than the heap
- a `vector` is a similar collection type provided by the standard library that is allowed to grow or shrink in size
- you can write an array type by using square brackets, and include type and length, ie. `let a: [i32; 5] = [1,2,3,4,5];`
- `let a = [3;5];` equals `[3,3,3,3,3]`

## Functions
- expressions do not include semicolons

## Loops
- `loop`, `while`, `for`
